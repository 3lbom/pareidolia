They stand eerily tall on the West coast of the Island of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.  These stones were set up between 2900 and 2600 BC and were a hive of activity during the Bronze age.  The area is open to the public and can be accessed easily.  There is an unusual haunting feeling when there, that is hard to explain. The Close Up Image shows thousands of years worth of weathered Lewisian Gneiss rock and the beautiful natural patterns that have been carved.\", \"Image Copyright\": \"Placebo365\"}",
