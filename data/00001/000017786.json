Island is shaped like an elephant's skull.  The deep black hole in the rock face resembles an eye.  Orange-coloured lichen fall down the rock face.  Dark blue water laps the base of the rock.  A solitary small penguin sits on the base of the rock at sea level. The rock sits in very clear, dark blue, calm waters, and bright blue sky stretches onto the horizon at the right hand side of the frame.\"}",
